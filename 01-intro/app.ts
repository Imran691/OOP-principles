// JS is not class based OOP language so it was not adopted by enterprise level applications
// TS has resolved this issue
// We can develope both front end and back end by using class based OOP model in TS
// We used different tools & frame works to develope full stack applications, these tools help us to develpe affectively with minimum time 
// For front end we will use React library of facebook, above that we will used Next.js framework
// For styling of front end we will used TailWnid.CSS and Chakra UI
// We can develope modern front end applications by using these tools.

// Library & frame works are reusable codes already written by some one that we can use in our applications

// Library is like a markete where we can get components of our shirts (for example) like, buttons, collors etc. We can finish our shirt by using components of the library.
// Frame work is like a ready shirt that we cen finish as we wish to do. We can skip design & stitching of the shirt by using frame works.

// They help us to solve our common problems in different ways
// We can used frame works and libraries together

// While using library we are incharge of the flow
// We can call library components when ever we need them
// We tell library what to do

// While using a frame work, frame work is incharge of the flow
// Application archetecture is decided by frame work
// Frame work tells us what to do

// Back end applicatios are needed to be hosted some where
// There are three stattegies for that
// 1- Hosting application by setting up server at your own location
//      This is called "own premises strategy"
//      It is very costly and not feasible to use

// 2- We can used services of some cloude service provider, e.g. subscriptions of Amazon web services, Google cloud plat form, Microsoft azure  and hosting application there.
//      This is called "full cloud model"
//      There are two pricing options
//      "Renting dedicated servers" its price is fixed regardless of usage

// 3- "Serverless strategy" we have to pay for the period we use the server
//      It saves a lot of money
//      For serverless back end development we will use "Amazon web services" which fully supports TypeScript
//      For that we will code "serverless Lambda functions", "APIs" & "data base technology" in TS.


// In OOP driving force of any application are "Class Based Objects".
//      For that first we need to create a class and then that class is used to create objects.
//      In JS we ceate functions to make modules and applications

//      In OOP systems are designed on the basis of 4 principles. "Abstraction", "Encapsulation", "Inheretence", "Poly morphism"
